<p>We have to think creatively to find more space for Boston’s growth. One way that many large cities have made room for growth is efficient land use. In this lesson discover the ways cities define and regulate land use to make the best use of this scarce resource, and learn what that means in terms of building size and capacity.</p>

<h3 id="a-density-defined">A. Density Defined</h3>

<p>A city’s zoning rules describe how “dense” a piece of land can be developed. Because the word “density” is an ambiguous term, we are going to outline four primary definitions below:</p>

<h4 id="1-amount-of-floor-space-or-floor-area-ratio-far">1. Amount of floor space, or “Floor Area Ratio (FAR)”</h4>
<p>The more floor space there is in a building, the more things can fit inside it. Planners conventionally use a metric called “Floor Area Ratio” (abbreviated to FAR) to describe the ratio of floor area inside a building to the land area it sits on (its parcel area).  FAR is an imprecise measure of density: in neighborhoods variable parcel sizes, two buildings equal in size would have different FAR’s.</p>

<h4 id="2-parcel-coverage">2. Parcel Coverage</h4>
<p>You can organize the same amount of floor space within a parcel differently. For instance, with an FAR of 1.0, you can lay it out all flat (so that it covers 100% of the parcel), or stack it high (so that it only covers a portion).</p>

<p>Different parcel coverages and FARs produce a variety of different building types, for example: single family detached housing, low-rise attached housing, or high-rise residential towers. Each of these produce different neighborhood characters.</p>

<h4 id="3-unit-size">3. Unit Size</h4>
<p>The amount of floor space each unit has is also a measure of density: smaller units means more units can fit inside a building. Counting the number of units (or ‘dwellings’) per acre of land is a convention used by urban planners to describe density, called “dwellings per acre”.</p>

<h4 id="4-population-density">4. Population Density</h4>
<p>Finally, we can also think of density in terms of population. The same apartment can house different numbers of people (for example, a single student, or a family of three). Many policies use metrics that calculate the average number of occupants per household.</p>

<h3 id="b-bostons-development-review-process">B. Boston’s Development Review Process</h3>
<p>The City plays a very important role in planning for future growth. A variety of different agencies have a role in reviewing proposed development projects depending on their size, type, and location. Developers assemble a team that can include attorneys, architects, planners, and other consultants to help them through the development review process. The overall process is described in the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_process.svg" alt="Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process" title="Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process" />

<p>There are many different people and government agencies that review a development project. The main agencies responsible for development permitting are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/">The Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services/zoning-board-appeal">The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services">The Inspectional Services Department (ISD)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple.  If the proposed project is compliant with the zoning code, a developer can apply for a building permit. If the proposed project needs exceptions from the zoning rules, the Zoning Board of Appeals must review the proposal. If the proposal is for more than 10 units, it must also comply with the City’s Inclusionary Development Policy, which sets aside a certain percentage of housing units for low- and moderate-income households.</p>

<p>TThe process is different for projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 square feet. For these larger developments, the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA) created clear guidelines for the development review process. The procedures for review of developments of this size are laid out in Article 80 of the Zoning Code.
