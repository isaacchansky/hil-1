<p>After exploring the first three modules, you might have discovered that building Income-restricted housing usually results in a gap in the development budget. This could result in limiting the production of affordable housing, but fortunately, the City of Boston has a number of funding initiatives to increase its production.</p>

<p>Resources for Individuals:
•Federal and State vouchers authorized by the Boston Housing Authority for Very-Low and Low Income households</p>

<p>Resources/requirements for developers:
•DND-sponsored affordable housing funding programs to help finance development of housing for low-income and moderate-income households  such as the Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds, Linkage Funds and Inclusionary Development Funds. These funds are often paired with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.
•To serve moderate-income and middle-income households, the City has an Inclusionary Development policy which is profiled in this module.</p>

<p>To serve families and households in these income groups:</p>

<h2 id="4b-profile-on-inclusionary-development-program-idp">4b. Profile on Inclusionary Development Program (IDP)</h2>

<p>In 2000, the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) was established which applies to almost all privately developed projects. The IDP requirement can be met with three different options or a combination.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523322024417_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families</p>

<p>Huge Impact: Under IDP, developers directly created over 2,000 affordable units and over $100 million in the IDP fund helped to support the creation of $1,200 additional affordable units.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind however, the use of city funds to produce affordable housing is not infinite…</p>
