<p>Compact living is a new type of residential development that uses well designed and efficient use of space paired with shared amenities to make housing more affordable. Compact units have smaller square footages than is currently allowed by zoning. Given the increasing cost of living and expected population growth, compact units offer a cost- and space-efficient way of building more units to accommodate growing demand for housing. There are three primary aspirations for Compact Living:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increase housing affordability by reducing unit size which leads to more housing supply</li>
  <li>Facilitate community-building and cohesion on a building and neighborhood scale through the shared common spaces</li>
  <li>Encourage creativity and innovation in design to meet the needs of residents</li>
</ul>

<p>Smaller unit sizes result in lower living costs because it means that developers can build more units for less. Because it costs less money to build these units, they can charge less rent. Because the units will be smaller, buildings with compact units will have more communal spaces. Examples of common spaces include a lounge, laundry room, fitness room, common kitchen and dining room, workspace, or outdoor spaces. The City has also proposed a Compact Policy Parking and Transportation Demand Management Plan to reduce parking requirements based on how far the building is from public transportation options.</p>

<p>The size (in square feet) that the City is considering for the Compact Policy are below:</p>

<h4 id="spotlight-uhu">Spotlight: UHU!</h4>

<p>The City of Boston recently demonstrated what compact living could look like by creating an “Urban Housing Unit” (UHU) and touring it around the city.  The City received feedback on the UHU from over 2,000 community members. The City heard that residents are open to smaller living space in exchange for other things they value such as convenience of location and amenities. There is more information about the UHU in the Resources section.</p>
