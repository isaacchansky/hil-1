        Understanding Housing Development:
        <span>A Toolkit</span>
      </h1>
      <p class="lead">
        The city has taken many steps in recent years, including the Mayorâ€™s <em>Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030</em> and <em>Imagine Boston 2030</em>, to address the lack of housing supply and affordable housing. Citizens had a role in shaping the overall vision for these plans.
        <br>
        In this online toolkit, you will find a series of four lesson modules and interactive exercises on housing development. You will be able to examine a variety of scenarios and analyze the tradeoffs that the City, community groups, advocates and developers balance every day.  At the end of the session, we will provide you with suggestions on how you can get involved in shaping the vision for your neighborhood.
