## Average Apartment Area (GSF) (Standard sizing)
The average apartment area in gross square feet (construction area) is calculated using the method described in the City of Boston's JP/ROX Density Bonus Program Financial Analysis (September 2016).

    value: 960 sqft

It evaluates this by combining the apartment-type share and their respective net square footage, and divides this by the indsutry-standard assumption construction efficiency rate of 85%, which takes into account area outside of units like hallways and stairwells. The breakdown is as follows (modified to avoid rounding errors):

|   Unit Type  |   Share of Total  | NSF per Unit  |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
|    Studio    |    22%            |    500 sqft   |
|    1-Bed     |    28%            |    750 sqft   |
|    2-Bed     |    33%            |    900 sqft   |
|    3-bed     |    17%            |    1200 sqft  |
|    **All**   |    **100%**      |     **960 sqft**  |
