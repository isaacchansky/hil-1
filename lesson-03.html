<p>Boston is a multi-modal city, which means that there are many transportation options other than cars available to residents - including the T, buses, and bicycles. When thinking about building new rental housing, a development team considers the nearby transportation options.</p>

This is especially true because different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs. These can make the building more expensive and require higher rents. Also, more parking doesn’t just mean higher rents - it can also mean fewer units or less ground floor retail space.</p>
