        <h2>An Interactive Educational Toolkit</h2>
        <p>This website enables you to discover various scenarios for housing development. Through a series of lessons and interactive exercises, you will be able to visualize different planning options and their effects on things like affordability, building bulk, or whether the development would be financially feasible.
        </p>
        <p>
        The tradeoffs between these outcomes are balanced every day by City Planners, Community Groups, and Development Teams — and have also been recorded in the Mayor’s Housing Plan and Imagine Boston 2030, where citizens had a role in shaping our overall vision for Boston’s growth.
        </p>
        <p>
        After completing the lessons, we will provide suggestions on how you can get involved in shaping the vision for your neighborhood.</p>

    <h3 id="housing-development-is-complex">Housing development is complex</h3>

<p>But it doesn’t have to be hard to understand!</p>

<p>This webapp presents four lesson-modules that explore aspects of housing development. Each lesson contains information about a specific topic in planning &amp; development, and then allows you to explore what different options concerning that topic may mean through visualizing a housing development in 3D. Try spinning the scene by clicking and dragging your cursor in the right-hand window!</p>

<p>The first lesson, “What are the Basics?”, outlines the fundamentals of development and planning, like size, density, and the permitting process.
The second lesson, “Balacing the Budget”, looks at the budget required to build new housing, and how that can be influenced by the intended affordability of apartments.
The third lesson, “What about Parking?”, showcases different options when it comes to parking capacity, and how those options have different costs and implications for the feasibility of a development.
The fourth lesson, “Compact Living”, offers the ability to test if different planning controls – in this case Boston’s new Compact Living Policy – could have an effect on housing affordability.</p>

<p>Finally, the last module allows you to choose <em>any</em> of the options in combination, so you can explore the full range of development scenarios, and uncover the trade-offs between affordability, feasibility, parking, bulk, or density. Which development do you think is best?</p>

<p>Once you have made it through, you can also access any of the lessons using the menu icon at the top left.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>

      What are the basics?
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: 07/16/2018</div>

    <p>A lot of people say that there is no land left in Boston to build more housing. If there is very little land, then we have to think creatively to find more space for Boston’s growth. One way that many large cities have made room for growth is in density. In this lesson discover the ways cities define and regulate development density, and what that means in terms of building size and capacity.</p>

<h3 id="a-what-is-zoning">A. What is Zoning?</h3>

<p>Zoning is a set of rules that describe how a piece of land can be used. For example, the Zoning Code determines how tall a building can be and whether it can be used for housing, offices, retail, or industry.</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_zoning.jpg" alt="Different Land Uses and Zoning Types" title="Some different types of buildings and land-uses" /></p>

<p><em>These are some different types of buildings and land-uses</em></p>

<p>The zoning code is very specific about the purpose of a building. For example, there are many types of housing within the “residential” category: single family, multi-family, hotels, senior housing, etc. Each neighborhood may have different types of housing.</p>

<p>As an example, South Boston is a neighborhood where most of the housing is “Multifamily Residential,” which means that you can build 4 or more units on each piece of land.</p>

<p>You can find the zoning rules for your neighborhood online! <a href="http://maps.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/zoningviewer/">Click here</a> and enter your address!</p>

<h3 id="b-density-defined">B. Density Defined</h3>

<p>The zoning rules describe how “dense” a piece of land can be developed. There are lots of ways to describe what density means in urban development, we are going to outline the main ones below:</p>

<h4 id="1-amount-of-floor-space-or-floor-area-ratio-far">1. Amount of floor space, or “Floor Area Ratio (FAR)”</h4>
<p>The more floor space there is in a building, the more things can fit inside it. Planners conventionally use a metric called “Floor Area Ratio” (abbreviated to F.A.R.) to describe the ratio of floor area inside a building to the area of the land it sits on (its parcel area)</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_far.jpg" alt="Visualizing various FARs of a parcel" title="Some FARs of a parcel" />
<em>Visualizing various FARs of a parcel</em></p>

<h4 id="2-building-coverage">2. Building Coverage</h4>
<p>You can organize the same amount of floor space within a parcel differently. For instance, you can lay it out all flat (so that it covers 100% of the parcel), or stack it high (sVarious o that it only covers a portion).</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_coverage.jpg" alt="Visualizing different coverages with the same FAR" title="Visualizing different coverages with the same FAR" />
<em>Visualizing different coverages with the same FAR</em></p>

<p>Different building coverages and FARs produce a variety of different urban development types, for example: low-rise attached housing (row houses), or high-rise towers. Each of these produce different neighborhood characters and outcomes.</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_densityFabrics.jpg" alt="Visualizing different urban fabric types" title="A variety of urban fabric types with the same FAR density (from Mozas &amp; Per, Density: New Collective Housing (2006))" />
<em>A variety of urban fabric types with the same FAR density (from Mozas &amp; Per, Density: New Collective Housing (2006))</em></p>

<h4 id="3-apartment-size">3. Apartment Size</h4>
<p>The amount of floor space each apartment has is also a measure of density: smaller units means more apartments can fit inside a building. Counting the number of apartments (or ‘dwellings’) per acre of land is a convention used by urban planners to describe density, called “dwellings per acre”.</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_dwellingUnits.jpg" alt="Visualizing different unit densities" title="Indicative diagram visualizing different apartment sizes &amp; unit densities" />
<em>Indicative diagram visualizing different apartment sizes &amp; unit densities.</em></p>

<h4 id="4-population-density">4. Population Density</h4>
<p>Finally, we can also think of density in terms of population. The same apartment can house different numbers of people (for example, a single student, or a family of three). Many policies use metrics that calculate the average number of occupants per household.</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_dwellingPop.jpg" alt="Visualizing different population densities" title="Diagrams visualizing different population densities" />
<em>Diagrams visualizing different population densities</em></p>

<h3 id="c-bostons-development-review-process">C. Boston’s Development Review Process</h3>
<p>The city plays a very important role in planning for future growth. Since the City regulates zoning, all new buildings are reviewed by a variety of city agencies. A development team’s attorney usually assists completing Boston’s Development Review process, including  paperwork and attending meetings. The overall process is described in the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_process.jpg" alt="Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process" title="Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process" />
<em>Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process</em></p>

<p>There are many different people and government agencies that review a development project. The main agencies responsible for development permitting are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/">The Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services/zoning-board-appeal">The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services">The Inspectional Services Department (ISD)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple. There is one required community meeting. If the proposed project needs exceptions from the zoning rules, the Zoning Board of Appeals must review the proposal.</p>

<p>The process is different for projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 square feet. For these larger developments, the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA) created clear guidelines for the development review process. These guidelines are referred to as “Article 80.” If you want to learn more, the <a href="http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/documents/about-the-bra/development-review/a-citizen-s-guide-to-article-80-january-2013">Citizens Guide to Article 80</a> is available on the BPDA’s website.</p>

      Balancing the Budget
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: 07/17/2018</div>

    <p>Now it’s time to learn about the financial feasibility of development projects by understanding their budgeting framework. Most people
don’t have enough money to pay for a whole building project so they use some of their own money and also seek financing from banks or other investors.</p>

<h2 id="a-how-does-housing-get-built">A. How does housing get built?</h2>
<p>Housing development is undertaken by a development team (usually a developer, designer, engineer, and builder), that secures financing by demonstrating the development budget can be repaid by the income generated through renting or selling the apartments. In this exercise, we will only look at renting the apartments.</p>

<h3 id="development-budget">Development Budget</h3>

<p>Putting together the development budget is similar to the process for purchasing a home. When buying a home you need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A down-payment - a percentage of the price paid up-front, and</li>
  <li>A loan - also known as a mortgage.</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are building new housing, the downpayment is called “equity.” Equity can either come from an investor, or from the developer’s own funds. Usually, the developer also needs to get a loan from a bank. When building new housing, this loan is called “debt.” The bank will decide how big this loan will be based on how much the future residents will pay in rent. This money from rent will be used to pay back the loan.</p>

<p>Developers need to use both equity and debt to pay for all of the development and construction costs involved in building housing. Together, equity and debt are referred to as “Sources of Funds.”
The costs for building a building are known as the “Uses of Funds”. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Paying for labor and construction materials</li>
  <li>Buying the land</li>
  <li>Design and financing fees (known as soft costs)</li>
  <li>Developer’s administration fees</li>
</ul>

<p>If the cost for constructing a building (Uses of Funds) balances with the Sources of Funds (equity and debt) available to the developer, the project is “feasible”, and can go ahead.</p>

<h3 id="operating-budget">Operating Budget</h3>
<p>In order to determine how much debt a developer can take on, a bank examines the projected income from renting the apartments to calculate how much the property can repay over time. The operating budget has two components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Income, which is mostly made up of money coming in from rent. When creating a budget, developers know that some apartments might be vacant, which means that no one will be paying rent from those units.</li>
  <li>Expenses, which are mostly maintenance costs, property management fees, property taxes and paying back the debt (loan) on the property that was used to construct the building.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the operating budget, the expenses to operate the building cannot be more than the income (i.e. rents) generated by the residents of the building.</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_budget.jpg" alt="Budget Diagram" title="A diagram of how the Development and Operating budgets must balance" />
<em>Balancing the Development and Operating Budgets</em></p>

<h2 id="b-what-about-housing-affordability">B. What about housing affordability?</h2>
<p>One thing that the City, development teams, and housing advocates consider is the affordability of newly-built housing. A rule of thumb is that housing is “affordable” if a household spends no more than 30% of their income on rent or mortgage.</p>

<p>But 30% of $1 million is very different from 30% of $20,000. So When the government says “affordable housing”, it means affordable for households in the middle or at the lower end of the income scale. In order to determine what those incomes are, the City uses a measure called “Area Median Income” (AMI) that calculates the median income of households in a given area. For Boston, the Department of Housing and Development uses all households in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy area, which means the median income for a household of three is $97,100. This is quite different from the median income for the same household within the City of Boston, which is $65,200.</p>

<h2 id="c-what-is-the-inclusionary-development-policy-idp">C. What is the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP)?</h2>
<p>In 2000, the City implemented the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP), which applies to all privately developed projects. This policy requires that all new developments contribute to the production of new affordable housing in the City. Developers can meet this requirement in three different ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Include affordable units within their developments (on-site),</li>
  <li>Create affordable housing in an off-site location, or</li>
  <li>Make a cash contribution towards the creation or preservation of affordable housing.</li>
</ol>

<p>IDP units generally target moderate-income and middle income households. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families. The policy has enabled developers to directly create over 2,000 affordable units, and over $100 million in the IDP fund has helped to support the creation of 1,200 additional off-site affordable units.</p>

<p>IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families.</p>

      How does parking work?
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: 07/16/2018</div>

    <p>Boston is a multi-modal city, which means that there are many transportation options other than cars available to residents - including the T, buses, and bicycles. When thinking about building new rental housing, a development team considers the nearby transportation options.</p>

<p>However, despite the availability of other forms of transportation, car parking remains a is a key consideration of all new housing development. This is especially true because different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs. These can make the building more expensive and require higher rents. Also, more parking doesn’t just mean higher rents - it can also mean fewer units or less ground floor retail space.</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_parking.jpg" alt="Space considerations with parking" title="Space considerations with parking" />
<em>Space considerations with parking</em></p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_parkingStack.jpg" alt="Cost considerations with parking" title="Cost considerations with parking" />
<em>Cost considerations with parking</em></p>

<p>The parking ratio of a development is the number of parking spaces available to each residential unit. Parking ratios are set by zoning. In some cases, the City is reviewing lower parking ratios for buildings that are constructed near public transportation because residents can use public transportation to meet their travel needs.</p>

<p>Traditional measures of housing affordability ignore transportation costs, typically the second largest category in a household’s budget. The Center for Neighborhood Technology releases an annual Housing + Transportation Cost Index to track these costs.

      Compact Living Policy
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: 07/17/2018</div>

    <p>Compact units are a promising model of development in Boston’s current housing context. Compact units have smaller square footages than is currently allowed by zoning. Given the increasing cost of living and expected population growth, compact units offer a cost- and space-efficient way of building more units to accommodate growing demand for housing. There are two primary goals for Compact Living, increased affordability and fostering community through common spaces that supplement smaller living quarters.</p>

<p>Smaller unit sizes result in lower living costs because it means that developers can build more units for less. Because it costs less money to build these units, they can charge less rent. Because the units will be smaller, buildings with compact units will have more communal spaces. Examples of common spaces include a lounge, laundry room, fitness room, common kitchen and dining room, workspace, or outdoor spaces. The City has also proposed a Compact Policy Parking and Transportation Demand Management Plan to reduce parking requirements based on how far the building is from public transportation options.</p>

<p>For more information, go to the Resources section to see sample floor plans of these compact unit apartment sizes.</p>

<h3 id="resources-and-next-steps">Resources and Next Steps:</h3>

<p>The City of Boston’s Compact Living policy is currently in draft form and under review.

<ul>
  <li>The “Market Rate” mix is set according to the City of Boston’s Inclusionary Development Policy, where 13% of apartments must be affordabel at 70% AMI. The rest of the apartments may have rents set at the prevailing market rates.</li>
  <li>“1/3 1/3 1/3” is a mix recommended by the City of Boston to achieve affordability and feasibility. This mix calls for one-third of apartments being affordable at 50% AMI, another third being affordable at 80% AMI, and the last third having market rate rents.</li>
  <li>Finally, “Deep Affordability” is a mix to achieve a very high amount of affordable apartments, with 10% of the apartments being affordable at 30% AMI, another 20% of apartments at 50% AMI, and the remaining 70% of apartments affordable at 60% AMI.</li>
