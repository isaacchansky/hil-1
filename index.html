    <h3 id="1a-what-is-zoning">1a. What is Zoning?</h3>

<p>Boston’s Zoning Code has rules for each area that describe the height, density, and uses that are allowed. You wouldn’t want a huge factory next to single-family homes, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523320422852_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In Boston, each parcel of land has specific zoning rules that describe the dimensional guidelines (building size) and use guidelines (purpose of building i.e. type of residential such as multifamily, hotel, senior housing).</p>

<p>For example, South Boston is mainly comprised of a defined housing type called Multifamily Residential or “MFR”, which generally means that you can build 4 or more units per parcel.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523320493619_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Or, West Roxbury (Article 56) is mainly comprised of 1F-6000, which generally means that you can build 1 unit per parcel of land.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523320509468_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you want to find the zoning rules for your neighborhood, you can find them in your neighborhood’s “Zoning Article” in the Boston Zoning Code.</p>

<h3 id="1b-density-defined">1b. Density Defined</h3>

<p>(all images used with permission from MIT’s densityatlas.org)</p>

<p>The zoning rules describe the allowed density on the parcel, i.e. the number of units and the size (also known as massing) of the building.  Planning the size and shape of the buildings can prevent overcrowding and protect public health and safety.</p>

<p>There are three parts to density: the amount of building that covers the parcel of land, the number of units in the building and the number of people housed in each unit in the building.</p>

<h3 id="1c-bostons-development-review-process">1c. Boston’s Development Review Process</h3>

<p>There are multiple stakeholders involved in the review of a development, including the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA), the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), and others. For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple. There is one required community meeting. If the project proposes to differ from the zoning rules, at least one meeting is also required with the Zoning Board of Appeals.</p>

<p>For projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 SF, the BPDA created Article 80 to provide clear guidelines for the development review process.  If you want to learn more, the Citizens Guide to Article 80 is available on the BPDA’s website.</p>

      Balancing the Budget

    <h2 id="2a-how-does-private-rental-housing-get-built">2a. How does Private Rental Housing Get Built?</h2>

<p>There are two budgets that are important in rental housing development, a development budget and an operating budget.</p>

<p><strong>Development Budget</strong>
The development process is similar to purchasing a home: a downpayment (small percentage of the purchase price) and a loan. To build new housing, developers use funds from themselves and investors to initiate a project (known as equity), as well as borrowing funds from a bank (known as debt). The bank determines the size of the loan based on future residents’ rents that will pay it back.
These funds (known as the Sources of Funds) are used to pay for the costs involved in building a building (known as the Uses of Funds): acquiring the land, paying for labor and construction materials, design and financing fees (known as soft costs), as well as the developer’s administration fees.
If the cost for constructing a building (Uses of Funds) balances with the Sources of Funds (equity and debt) available to the developer, the project can go ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Operating Budget</strong>
In the operating budget, the expenses to operate the building cannot exceed the income (i.e. rents) generated by the residents of the building. Income is typically comprised of the Rents. Expenses are mostly comprised of maintenance costs, property management fees, and property taxes.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523321380550_Slide06.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="2b-what-exactly-is-affordable-housing">2b. What exactly IS affordable housing?</h2>

<p>Often when we hear developers, the City or residents talk about Affordable Housing, they mean Income Restricted Housing. In this toolkit, when we say housing that is affordable, what we mean is housing that costs around 30% of a family’s income. When we say Affordable housing/unit, we mean Income-restricted, often defined by “Area Median Income” (AMI).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ami-and-why-do-people-say-it-doesnt-represent-boston">What is AMI and why do people say it doesn’t represent Boston?</h2>

<p>To serve diverse families with different incomes, we need a range of affordable housing options with different income maximums and rents which is created around a term called “Area Median Income” or AMI.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates AMI by looking at all families who live in an area, ordering them up by income, and then reporting the income of the family in the middle.  HUD uses the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MSA to calculate AMI. This large area of communities skews the income higher than the median family income of residents f Boston. The City of Boston Median Income is $65,238 (Household size of 2.8) while the Boston MSA region median family income is $93,100 (for a household size of 3). That’s a BIG difference!

      How does parking work?
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: Jun 5, 2018</div>

    <p>Parking is a key consideration of all new housing development. Different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs. These can make the building more expensive and require higher rents. The parking ratio of a development is the number of parking spaces available to each residential unit. Parking ratios are set by zoning. In some cases, the City is reviewing lower parking ratios for building that are constructed near public transportation because residents use public transportation to meet their travel needs.</p>

    <h2 id="4a-making-the-numbers-work-public-subsidies">4a. Making the numbers work: Public Subsidies</h2>

<p>After exploring the first three modules, you might have discovered that building Income-restricted housing usually results in a gap in the development budget. This could result in limiting the production of affordable housing, but fortunately, the City of Boston has a number of funding initiatives to increase its production.</p>

<p>Resources for Individuals:
•Federal and State vouchers authorized by the Boston Housing Authority for Very-Low and Low Income households</p>

<p>Resources/requirements for developers:
•DND-sponsored affordable housing funding programs to help finance development of housing for low-income and moderate-income households  such as the Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds, Linkage Funds and Inclusionary Development Funds. These funds are often paired with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.
•To serve moderate-income and middle-income households, the City has an Inclusionary Development policy which is profiled in this module.</p>

<p>To serve families and households in these income groups:</p>

<h2 id="4b-profile-on-inclusionary-development-program-idp">4b. Profile on Inclusionary Development Program (IDP)</h2>

<p>In 2000, the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) was established which applies to almost all privately developed projects. The IDP requirement can be met with three different options or a combination.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523322024417_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523322041286_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Huge Impact: Under IDP, developers directly created over 2,000 affordable units and over $100 million in the IDP fund helped to support the creation of $1,200 additional affordable units.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind however, the use of city funds to produce affordable housing is not infinite…</p>
