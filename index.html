    <h3 id="1a-what-is-zoning">1a. What is Zoning?</h3>

<p>Boston’s Zoning Code has rules for each area that describe the height, density, and uses that are allowed. You wouldn’t want a huge factory next to single-family homes, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523320422852_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In Boston, each parcel of land has specific zoning rules that describe the dimensional guidelines (building size) and use guidelines (purpose of building i.e. type of residential such as multifamily, hotel, senior housing).</p>

<p>For example, South Boston is mainly comprised of a defined housing type called Multifamily Residential or “MFR”, which generally means that you can build 4 or more units per parcel.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523320493619_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Or, West Roxbury (Article 56) is mainly comprised of 1F-6000, which generally means that you can build 1 unit per parcel of land.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523320509468_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you want to find the zoning rules for your neighborhood, you can find them in your neighborhood’s “Zoning Article” in the Boston Zoning Code.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523320447190_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="1b-density-defined">1b. Density Defined</h3>

<p>(all images used with permission from MIT’s densityatlas.org)</p>

<p>The zoning rules describe the allowed density on the parcel, i.e. the number of units and the size (also known as massing) of the building.  Planning the size and shape of the buildings can prevent overcrowding and protect public health and safety.</p>

<p>There are three parts to density: the amount of building that covers the parcel of land, the number of units in the building and the number of people housed in each unit in the building.</p>

<h3 id="1c-bostons-development-review-process">1c. Boston’s Development Review Process</h3>

<p>There are multiple stakeholders involved in the review of a development, including the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA), the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), and others. For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple. There is one required community meeting. If the project proposes to differ from the zoning rules, at least one meeting is also required with the Zoning Board of Appeals.</p>

<p>For projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 SF, the BPDA created Article 80 to provide clear guidelines for the development review process.  If you want to learn more, the Citizens Guide to Article 80 is available on the BPDA’s website.</p>

      Balancing the Budget
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: Jun 5, 2018</div>

    <h2 id="2a-how-does-private-rental-housing-get-built">2a. How does Private Rental Housing Get Built?</h2>

<p>There are two budgets that are important in rental housing development, a development budget and an operating budget.</p>

<p><strong>Development Budget</strong>
The development process is similar to purchasing a home: a downpayment (small percentage of the purchase price of the home) and a loan, also known as a mortgage. To build new housing, the equivalent to a downpayment is called equity. Equity often comes from an investor or from the developer’s own funds and is required by the lender to initiate a project. To build new housing, the equivalent to a mortgage is called debt and these are funds typically borrowed from a bank. The bank determines the size of the loan based on future residents’ rents that will pay it back.</p>

<p>Combining equity and debt, these funds are referred to as the Sources of Funds and are used to pay for all of the development and construction costs involved in building a building. The costs for building a building are known as the Uses of Funds and these include: acquiring the land, paying for labor and construction materials, design and financing fees (known as soft costs), as well as the developer’s administration fees. If the cost for constructing a building (Uses of Funds) balances with the Sources of Funds (equity and debt) available to the developer, the project can go ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Operating Budget</strong>
In the operating budget, the Income and Expenses must balance. Income is typically comprised of rental income and takes into account some losses due apartment vacancies. Expenses are mostly comprised of maintenance costs, property management fees, property taxes and paying back the debt on the property that was used to construct the building.  The expenses to operate the building cannot exceed the income (i.e. rents) generated by the residents of the building or else there will be a deficit of funds and there could be deferred maintenance or risk of foreclosure due to late debt payments or tax payments.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523321380550_Slide06.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="2b-what-exactly-is-affordable-housing">2b. What exactly IS affordable housing?</h2>

<p>Often when we hear developers, the City or residents talk about Affordable Housing, they mean Income Restricted Housing. In this toolkit, when we say housing that is affordable, what we mean is housing that costs around 30% of a family’s income. When we say Affordable housing/unit, we mean Income-restricted, often defined by “Area Median Income” (AMI).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-ami-and-why-do-people-say-it-doesnt-represent-boston">What is AMI and why do people say it doesn’t represent Boston?</h2>

<p>To serve diverse families with different incomes, we need a range of affordable housing options with different income maximums and rents which is created around a term called “Area Median Income” or AMI.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates AMI by looking at all families who live in an area, ordering them up by income, and then reporting the income of the family in the middle.  HUD uses the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MSA to calculate AMI. This large area of communities skews the income higher than the median family income of residents f Boston. The City of Boston Median Income is $65,238 (Household size of 2.8) while the Boston MSA region median family income is $97,100 (for a household size of 3). That’s a BIG difference!

<h2 id="2c-profile-on-inclusionary-development-program-idp">2c. Profile on Inclusionary Development Program (IDP)</h2>

<p>In 2000, the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) was established which applies to almost all privately developed projects. The IDP requirement can be met with three different options or a combination.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523322024417_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_0ECA986A12324EE3FB5983FDA03FC6AC80BE5DB47781F11F1AEC6FC62AF9731D_1523322041286_image.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Huge Impact: Under IDP, developers directly created over 2,000 affordable units and over $100 million in the IDP fund helped to support the creation of $1,200 additional affordable units.</p>

      How does parking work?
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: Jun 5, 2018</div>

    <p>Parking is a key consideration of all new housing development. Different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs. These can make the building more expensive and require higher rents. The parking ratio of a development is the number of parking spaces available to each residential unit. Parking ratios are set by zoning. In some cases, the City is reviewing lower parking ratios for building that are constructed near public transportation because residents use public transportation to meet their travel needs.</p>

      Compact Living Policy
    </h2>
    <div class="lesson__meta">Last updated: Jun 3, 2018</div>

    <h2 id="4a-compact-living">4a. Compact Living</h2>

<p>Compact units are a promising model of development in Boston’s current housing context. Compact units have smaller square footages than is currently allowed by zoning. Given the increasing cost of living and expected population growth, compact units offer a cost- and space-efficient way of building more units to accommodate growing demand for housing. There are two primary goals for Compact Living, increased affordability and fostering community through common spaces that supplement smaller living quarters.</p>

<p>Smaller unit sizes result in reduced living costs and economies of scale for developers that can lead to lower rents. Examples of common spaces include a lounge, laundry room, fitness room, common kitchen and dining room, workspace, or outdoor spaces. The City has also proposed a Compact Policy Parking and Transportation Demand Management Plan to reduce parking requirements based on the building’s distance from transit.</p>

<p>The square footage ranges under consideration are below:
Unit Type                    Compact Unit Square Footage Range   |    Existing Minimum Square Footage
Studio                       250-450 SF                          |     450 SF
1 Bedroom                    400-625 SF                          |     625 SF
2 Bedroom                    600-850 SF                          |     850 SF
3 Bedroom                    700-1,100 SF</p>

<p>For more information, go to the Resources section to see sample floor plans of these compact unit apartment sizes.</p>

<h3 id="spotlight-uhu">Spotlight: UHU!</h3>

<p>The City of Boston’s recently undertook a demonstration project, the Urban Housing Unit (UHU), touring the exhibit around the city and receiving feedback from over 2,000 community members. The City heard that residents are open to smaller living space in exchange for other things they value such as convenience of location and amenities. There is more information about the UHU in the Resources section.</p>

<h3 id="resources-and-next-steps">Resources and Next Steps:</h3>

<p>The City of Boston’s Compact Living policy is currently in draft form and under review.
