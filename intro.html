<p>But it doesn’t have to be hard to understand!</p>

<p>This webapp presents four lesson-modules that explore aspects of housing production. Each lesson contains information about a specific topic in planning &amp; development regulation, and then allows you to explore the implications of those regulations in a 3D visualization.</p>

<p>The first lesson, “What are the Basics?”, outlines the fundamentals of development regulations including size, density, and the permitting requirements.</p>

<p>The second lesson, “Balancing the Budget”, looks at the budget required to build new housing, and how that can be influenced by the intended affordability of apartments.</p>

<p>The third lesson, “How Does Parking Work?”, showcases different options when it comes to off-street parking capacity, and how those options have different costs, and implications for the feasibility of a development and cost of housing.</p>

<p>The fourth lesson, “Compact Living”, offers the ability to test if different planning controls – in this case Boston’s new Compact Living Policy – could have an effect on housing affordability.</p>

<p>Finally, the last module allows you to choose any of the options in combination, so you can explore the full range of development scenarios, and uncover the trade-offs between affordability, feasibility, parking, or building dimensions. Which development do you think is best?</p>

<p>Once you have made it through, you can also access any of the lessons using the menu icon at the top left.</p>

<p>Let’s get started!</p>
