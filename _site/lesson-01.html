<p>A lot of people say that there is no land left in Boston to build more housing. If there is very little land, then we have to think creatively to find more space for Boston’s growth. One way that many large cities have made room for growth is in density. In this lesson discover the ways cities define and regulate development density, and what that means in terms of building size and capacity.</p>

<h3 id="a-what-is-zoning">A. What is Zoning?</h3>

<p>Zoning is a set of rules that describe how a piece of land can be used. For example, the Zoning Code determines how tall a building can be and whether it can be used for housing, offices, retail, or industry.</p>

<p><em>These are some different types of buildings and land-uses</em></p>

<p>The zoning code is very specific about the purpose of a building. For example, there are many types of housing within the “residential” category: single family, multi-family, hotels, senior housing, etc. Each neighborhood may have different types of housing.</p>

<p>As an example, South Boston is a neighborhood where most of the housing is “Multifamily Residential,” which means that you can build 4 or more units on each piece of land.</p>

<h3 id="b-density-defined">B. Density Defined</h3>

<p>The zoning rules describe how “dense” a piece of land can be developed. There are lots of ways to describe what density means in urban development, we are going to outline the main ones below:</p>

<h4 id="1-amount-of-floor-space-or-floor-area-ratio-far">1. Amount of floor space, or “Floor Area Ratio (FAR)”</h4>
<p>The more floor space there is in a building, the more things can fit inside it. Planners conventionally use a metric called “Floor Area Ratio” (abbreviated to F.A.R.) to describe the ratio of floor area inside a building to the area of the land it sits on (its parcel area)</p>

<h4 id="2-building-coverage">2. Building Coverage</h4>
<p>You can organize the same amount of floor space within a parcel differently. For instance, you can lay it out all flat (so that it covers 100% of the parcel), or stack it high (sVarious o that it only covers a portion).</p>

<em>Visualizing different coverages with the same FAR</em></p>

<p>Different building coverages and FARs produce a variety of different urban development types, for example: low-rise attached housing (row houses), or high-rise towers. Each of these produce different neighborhood characters and outcomes.</p>

<h4 id="3-apartment-size">3. Apartment Size</h4>
<p>The amount of floor space each apartment has is also a measure of density: smaller units means more apartments can fit inside a building. Counting the number of apartments (or ‘dwellings’) per acre of land is a convention used by urban planners to describe density, called “dwellings per acre”.</p>

<h4 id="4-population-density">4. Population Density</h4>
<p>Finally, we can also think of density in terms of population. The same apartment can house different numbers of people (for example, a single student, or a family of three). Many policies use metrics that calculate the average number of occupants per household.</p>

<h3 id="c-bostons-development-review-process">C. Boston’s Development Review Process</h3>
<p>The city plays a very important role in planning for future growth. Since the City regulates zoning, all new buildings are reviewed by a variety of city agencies. A development team’s attorney usually assists completing Boston’s Development Review process, including  paperwork and attending meetings. The overall process is described in the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src="/housingilab/images/diagrams_process.jpg" alt="Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process" title="Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process" />
<em>Simplified diagram of the Development Review Process</em></p>

<p>There are many different people and government agencies that review a development project. The main agencies responsible for development permitting are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bostonplans.org/">The Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services/zoning-board-appeal">The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services">The Inspectional Services Department (ISD)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple. There is one required community meeting. If the proposed project needs exceptions from the zoning rules, the Zoning Board of Appeals must review the proposal.</p>

<p>The process is different for projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 square feet. For these larger developments, the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA) created clear guidelines for the development review process. These guidelines are referred to as “Article 80.” If you want to learn more, the <a href="http://www.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/documents/about-the-bra/development-review/a-citizen-s-guide-to-article-80-january-2013">Citizens Guide to Article 80</a> is available on the BPDA’s website.</p>
