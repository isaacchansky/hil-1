<p>Compact units are a promising model of development in Boston’s current housing context. Compact units have smaller square footages than is currently allowed by zoning. Given the increasing cost of living and expected population growth, compact units offer a cost- and space-efficient way of building more units to accommodate growing demand for housing. There are two primary goals for Compact Living, increased affordability and fostering community through common spaces that supplement smaller living quarters.</p>

<p>Smaller unit sizes result in lower living costs because it means that developers can build more units for less. Because it costs less money to build these units, they can charge less rent. Because the units will be smaller, buildings with compact units will have more communal spaces. Examples of common spaces include a lounge, laundry room, fitness room, common kitchen and dining room, workspace, or outdoor spaces. The City has also proposed a Compact Policy Parking and Transportation Demand Management Plan to reduce parking requirements based on how far the building is from public transportation options.</p>
