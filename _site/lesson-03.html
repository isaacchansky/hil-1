<p>Boston is a multi-modal city, which means that there are many transportation options available to residents - including transit, bicycles, walking, and automobiles. When thinking about building new housing, a development team considers the nearby transportation options.</p>

<p>Because different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs and space requirements, parking ultimately influences the cost of housing, potentially making a building more expensive and requiring higher rents or sales prices. Also, more parking doesn’t just mean potentially higher housing costs - it can also mean fewer units or less ground floor retail space.</p>

<p>The parking ratio of a development is the number of parking spaces built relative to each residential unit. Minimum and maximum parking ratios are set by zoning, and by guidelines from the Boston Transportation Department. Generally speaking, lower parking ratios and parking ratio maximums are used for areas adjacent to transit</p>

<p>Traditional measures of housing affordability ignore transportation costs, typically the second largest category in a household’s budget. The Center for Neighborhood Technology releases an annual Housing + Transportation Cost Index to track these costs.
