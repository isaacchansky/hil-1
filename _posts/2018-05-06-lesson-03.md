Parking is a key consideration of all new housing development. Different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs. These can make the building more expensive and require higher rents. The parking ratio of a development is the number of parking spaces available to each residential unit. Parking ratios are set by zoning. In some cases, the City is reviewing lower parking ratios for building that are constructed near public transportation because residents use public transportation to meet their travel needs.

It is important to keep in mind that every time a new building includes space for cars, it passes those costs on to the tenants. More parking doesn’t just mean higher rents- it means fewer units or potential ground floor commercial space because it takes up valuable space on the parcel.

### Resources and Next Steps for Development Basics:  
Traditional measures of housing affordability ignore transportation costs, typically the second largest category in a household’s budget. The Center for Neighborhood Technology releases an annual Housing + Transportation Cost Index to track these costs.
