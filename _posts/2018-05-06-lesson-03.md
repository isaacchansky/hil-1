Parking is a key consideration of all new housing development. Different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs. These can make the building more expensive and require higher rents. The parking ratio of a development is the number of parking spaces available to each residential unit. Parking ratios are set by zoning. In some cases, the City is reviewing lower parking ratios for buildings that are constructed near public transportation because residents can use public transportation to meet their travel needs.
