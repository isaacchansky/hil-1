Boston is a multi-modal city, which means that there are many transportation options other than cars available to residents - including the T, buses, and bicycles. When thinking about building new rental housing, a development team considers the nearby transportation options.

However, despite the availability of other forms of transportation, car parking remains a is a key consideration of all new housing development. This is especially true because different types of parking arrangements have different construction costs. These can make the building more expensive and require higher rents. Also, more parking doesn’t just mean higher rents - it can also mean fewer units or less ground floor retail space.

The parking ratio of a development is the number of parking spaces available to each residential unit. Parking ratios are set by zoning. In some cases, the City is reviewing lower parking ratios for buildings that are constructed near public transportation because residents can use public transportation to meet their travel needs.

### Resources and Next Steps for Development Basics:
Traditional measures of housing affordability ignore transportation costs, typically the second largest category in a household’s budget. The Center for Neighborhood Technology releases an annual Housing + Transportation Cost Index to track these costs.
