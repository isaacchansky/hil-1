### 1a. What is Zoning?

Boston’s Zoning Code is a set of rules that describe how a piece of land can be used. For example, the Zoning Code determines how tall a building can be and whether it can be used for housing, offices, retail, or industry.

The zoning code is very specific about the purpose of a building. For example, there are many types of housing within the “residential” category: single family, multi-family, hotels, senior housing, etc. Each neighborhood may have different types of housing.

As an example, South Boston is a neighborhood where most of the housing is “Multifamily Residential,” which means that you can build 4 or more units on each piece of land.

West Roxbury is a neighborhood that has mostly single-family homes.

### 1b. Density Defined

The zoning rules describe how “dense” a parcel can be. This means that the rules determine how many units can be built on a piece of land, and how big they can be.

There are three parts to density:

1. How bulky is the building?
2. How many units are in the building?
3. How many people live in each unit in the building?

### 1c. Boston’s Development Review Process

There are many different people and government agencies that review a development project:

-[The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)](https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services/zoning-board-appeal)

-[The Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA)](http://www.bostonplans.org/)

-and others! (link?)


For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple. There is one required community meeting. If the proposed project needs exceptions from the zoning rules, the [zoning board of appeals](https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services/zoning-board-appeal) must review the proposal.

The process is different for projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 square feet. For these larger developments, the BPDA (Boston Planning and Development Agency) created clear guidelines for the development review process. These guidelines are referred to as “Article 80.” If you want to learn more, the [Citizens Guide to Article 80 is available on the BPDA’s website](http://www.bostonplans.org/projects/development-review/what-is-article-80).
