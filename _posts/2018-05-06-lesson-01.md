### A. What is Zoning?

Zoning is a set of rules that describe how a piece of land can be used. For example, the Zoning Code determines how tall a building can be and whether it can be used for housing, offices, retail, or industry.

*These are some different types of buildings and land-uses*

The zoning code is very specific about the purpose of a building. For example, there are many types of housing within the “residential” category: single family, multi-family, hotels, senior housing, etc. Each neighborhood may have different types of housing. 

As an example, South Boston is a neighborhood where most of the housing is “Multifamily Residential,” which means that you can build 4 or more units on each piece of land.

You can find the zoning rules for your neighborhood online! [Click here](http://maps.bostonredevelopmentauthority.org/zoningviewer/) and enter your address!

### B. Density Defined

The zoning rules describe how “dense” a piece of land can be developed. There are lots of ways to describe what density means in urban development, we are going to outline the main ones below:

#### 1. Amount of floor space, or “Floor Area Ratio (F.A.R.)”
The more floor space there is in a building, the more things can fit inside it. Planners conventionally use a metric called “Floor Area Ratio” (abbreviated to F.A.R.) to describe the ratio of floor area inside a building to the area of the land it sits on (its parcel area)

#### 2. Building Coverage
You can organize the same amount of floor space within a parcel differently. For instance, you can lay it out all flat (so that it covers 100% of the parcel), or stack it high (sVarious o that it only covers a portion).

### Population



### 1c. Boston’s Development Review Process

There are many different people and government agencies that review a development project:

-[The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA)](https://www.boston.gov/departments/inspectional-services/zoning-board-appeal)

-[The Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA)](http://www.bostonplans.org/)

-and others! (link?)

For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple. There is one required community meeting. If the proposed project needs exceptions from the zoning rules, the Zoning Board of Appeals must review the proposal.

The process is different for projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 square feet. For these larger developments, the BPDA (Boston Planning and Development Agency) created clear guidelines for the development review process. These guidelines are referred to as “Article 80”. If you want to learn more, the [Citizens Guide to Article 80](http://www.bostonplans.org/projects/development-review/what-is-article-80) is available on the BPDA’s website.
