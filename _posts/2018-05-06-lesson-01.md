### 1a. What is Zoning?

Boston’s Zoning Code has rules for each area that describe the height, density, and uses that are allowed. You wouldn’t want a huge factory next to single-family homes, right?

In Boston, each parcel of land has specific zoning rules that describe the dimensional guidelines (building size) and use guidelines (purpose of building i.e. type of residential such as multifamily, hotel, senior housing).

For example, South Boston is mainly comprised of a defined housing type called Multifamily Residential or “MFR”, which generally means that you can build 4 or more units per parcel.

Or, West Roxbury (Article 56) is mainly comprised of 1F-6000, which generally means that you can build 1 unit per parcel of land.

If you want to find the zoning rules for your neighborhood, you can find them in your neighborhood’s “Zoning Article” in the Boston Zoning Code.

### 1b. Density Defined

The zoning rules describe the allowed density on the parcel, i.e. the number of units and the size (also known as massing) of the building.  Planning the size and shape of the buildings can prevent overcrowding and protect public health and safety.

There are three parts to density: the amount of building that covers the parcel of land, the number of units in the building and the number of people housed in each unit in the building.

### 1c. Boston’s Development Review Process

There are multiple stakeholders involved in the review of a development, including the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA), the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), and others. For projects smaller than 15 units, the process is quite simple. There is one required community meeting. If the project proposes to differ from the zoning rules, at least one meeting is also required with the Zoning Board of Appeals.

For projects with at least 15 units or 20,000 SF, the BPDA created Article 80 to provide clear guidelines for the development review process.  If you want to learn more, the Citizens Guide to Article 80 is available on the BPDA’s website.
