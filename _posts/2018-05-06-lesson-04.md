## 4a. Making the numbers work: Public Subsidies

After exploring the first three modules, you might have discovered that building Income-restricted housing usually results in a gap in the development budget. This could result in limiting the production of affordable housing, but fortunately, the City of Boston has a number of funding initiatives to increase its production.

Resources for Individuals:
•Federal and State vouchers authorized by the Boston Housing Authority for Very-Low and Low Income households

Resources/requirements for developers:
•DND-sponsored affordable housing funding programs to help finance development of housing for low-income and moderate-income households  such as the Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds, Linkage Funds and Inclusionary Development Funds. These funds are often paired with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program.
•To serve moderate-income and middle-income households, the City has an Inclusionary Development policy which is profiled in this module.

To serve families and households in these income groups:

## 4b. Profile on Inclusionary Development Program (IDP)

In 2000, the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) was established which applies to almost all privately developed projects. The IDP requirement can be met with three different options or a combination.

IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families

Huge Impact: Under IDP, developers directly created over 2,000 affordable units and over $100 million in the IDP fund helped to support the creation of $1,200 additional affordable units.


One thing to keep in mind however, the use of city funds to produce affordable housing is not infinite…
