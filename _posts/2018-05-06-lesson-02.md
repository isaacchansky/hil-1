## 2a. How does Private Rental Housing Get Built?

There are two budgets that are important in rental housing development, a development budget and an operating budget.

**Development Budget**
The development process is similar to purchasing a home: a downpayment (small percentage of the purchase price) and a loan. To build new housing, developers use funds from themselves and investors to initiate a project (known as equity), as well as borrowing funds from a bank (known as debt). The bank determines the size of the loan based on future residents’ rents that will pay it back.
These funds (known as the Sources of Funds) are used to pay for the costs involved in building a building (known as the Uses of Funds): acquiring the land, paying for labor and construction materials, design and financing fees (known as soft costs), as well as the developer’s administration fees.
If the cost for constructing a building (Uses of Funds) balances with the Sources of Funds (equity and debt) available to the developer, the project can go ahead.

**Operating Budget**
In the operating budget, the expenses to operate the building cannot exceed the income (i.e. rents) generated by the residents of the building. Income is typically comprised of the Rents. Expenses are mostly comprised of maintenance costs, property management fees, and property taxes.

## 2b. What exactly IS affordable housing?

Often when we hear developers, the City or residents talk about Affordable Housing, they mean Income Restricted Housing. In this toolkit, when we say housing that is affordable, what we mean is housing that costs around 30% of a family’s income. When we say Affordable housing/unit, we mean Income-restricted, often defined by “Area Median Income” (AMI).


## What is AMI and why do people say it doesn’t represent Boston?

To serve diverse families with different incomes, we need a range of affordable housing options with different income maximums and rents which is created around a term called “Area Median Income” or AMI.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates AMI by looking at all families who live in an area, ordering them up by income, and then reporting the income of the family in the middle.  HUD uses the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy MSA to calculate AMI. This large area of communities skews the income higher than the median family income of residents f Boston. The City of Boston Median Income is $65,238 (Household size of 2.8) while the Boston MSA region median family income is $93,100 (for a household size of 3). That’s a BIG difference!

## What is the sliding scale of Income Limits and Rents in Boston?

The chart to the left shows the ranges of incomes as represented by AMI. The affordable rent for a two-bedroom apartment is defined as 30% of the income for that household.

## 2c. Profile on Inclusionary Development Program (IDP)

In 2000, the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP) was established which applies to almost all privately developed projects. The IDP requirement can be met with three different options or a combination.

IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families

Huge Impact: Under IDP, developers directly created over 2,000 affordable units and over $100 million in the IDP fund helped to support the creation of $1,200 additional affordable units.
