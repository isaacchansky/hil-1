Now it’s time to learn about the financial feasibility of development projects by understanding their budgeting framework. Most people
don’t have enough money to pay for a whole building project so they use some of their own money and also seek financing from banks or other investors.

## A. How does housing get built?
Housing development is undertaken by a development team (usually a developer, designer, engineer, and builder), that secures financing by demonstrating the development budget can be repaid by the income generated through renting or selling the apartments. In this exercise, we will only look at renting the apartments.

### Development Budget

Putting together the development budget is similar to the process for purchasing a home. When buying a home you need:

  * A down-payment - a percentage of the price paid up-front, and
  * A loan - also known as a mortgage.

When you are building new housing, the downpayment is called “equity.” Equity can either come from an investor, or from the developer’s own funds. Usually, the developer also needs to get a loan from a bank. When building new housing, this loan is called “debt.” The bank will decide how big this loan will be based on how much the future residents will pay in rent. This money from rent will be used to pay back the loan.

Developers need to use both equity and debt to pay for all of the development and construction costs involved in building housing. Together, equity and debt are referred to as “Sources of Funds.”
The costs for building a building are known as the “Uses of Funds”. These include:

  * Paying for labor and construction materials
  * Buying the land
  * Design and financing fees (known as soft costs)
  * Developer’s administration fees


If the cost for constructing a building (Uses of Funds) balances with the Sources of Funds (equity and debt) available to the developer, the project is “feasible”, and can go ahead.

### Operating Budget
In order to determine how much debt a developer can take on, a bank examines the projected income from renting the apartments to calculate how much the property can repay over time. The operating budget has two components:

  * Income, which is mostly made up of money coming in from rent. When creating a budget, developers know that some apartments might be vacant, which means that no one will be paying rent from those units.

  * Expenses, which are mostly maintenance costs, property management fees, property taxes and paying back the debt (loan) on the property that was used to construct the building.

In the operating budget, the expenses to operate the building cannot be more than the income (i.e. rents) generated by the residents of the building.

## B. What about housing affordability?
One thing that the City, development teams, and housing advocates consider is the affordability of newly-built housing. A rule of thumb is that housing is "affordable" if a household spends no more than 30% of their income on rent or mortgage.

But 30% of $1 million is very different from 30% of $20,000. So When the government says "affordable housing", it means affordable for households in the middle or at the lower end of the income scale. In order to determine what those incomes are, the City uses a measure called "Area Median Income" (AMI) that calculates the median income of households in a given area. For Boston, the Department of Housing and Development uses all households in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy area, which means the median income for a household of three is $97,100. This is quite different from the median income for the same household within the City of Boston, which is $65,200.


## C. What is the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP)?
In 2000, the City implemented the Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP), which applies to all privately developed projects. This policy requires that all new developments contribute to the production of new affordable housing in the City. Developers can meet this requirement in three different ways:

1. Include affordable units within their developments (on-site),
2. Create affordable housing in an off-site location, or
3. Make a cash contribution towards the creation or preservation of affordable housing.

IDP units generally target moderate-income and middle income households. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families. The policy has enabled developers to directly create over 2,000 affordable units, and over $100 million in the IDP fund has helped to support the creation of 1,200 additional off-site affordable units.

IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families.
