### 2a. How does Private Rental Housing Get Built?

#### Development Budget

Putting together the development budget is similar to the process for purchasing a home. You need:
  - A Downpayment - a small percentage of the price of the house, and
  - A Loan - also known as a mortgage.

When you are building new housing, the **downpayment** is called “equity”. Equity can either come from an investor, or from the developer’s own funds. Usually, the developer also needs to get a **loan** from a bank. When building new housing, this loan is called “debt”. The bank will decide how big this loan will be based on how much the future residents will pay in rent. This money from rent will be used to pay back the loan.

Developers need to use both Equity and Debt to pay for all of the development and construction costs involved in building housing. Together, equity and debt are referred to as “Sources of Funds”.
The costs for building a building are known as the Uses of Funds and these include:

  - Paying for labor and construction materials
  - Buying the land
  - Design and financing fees (known as soft costs)
  - Developer’s administration fees

If the cost for constructing a building (Uses of Funds) balances with the Sources of Funds (equity and debt) available to the developer, the project can go ahead.

#### Operating Budget
In the operating budget, the Income and Expenses must balance.

**Income** is mostly made up of money coming in from rent. When creating a budget, developers know that some apartments might be vacant, which means that no one will be paying rent from those units.

**Expenses** are mostly maintenance costs, property management fees, property taxes and paying back the debt (loan) on the property that was used to construct the building. The expenses to operate the building cannot be more than the income (i.e. rents) generated by the residents of the building. When the expenses are more than the income, it is called a “deficit of funds.” If there is a deficit, the owner of the building might not be able to pay for maintenance. They also might be at risk of foreclosure.

### 2b. What exactly IS Affordable Housing?

When developers, the City or residents talk about Affordable Housing, they often mean Income Restricted Housing. In order to serve diverse families with different incomes, we need a range of affordable housing options. These housing options need to have different income maximums and rent levels. The City sets these income and rent restrictions using something called the “Area Median Income” or AMI. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates AMI by looking at all families who live in an area, ordering them up by income, and then reporting the income of the family in the middle. HUD uses the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy metropolitan statistical area to calculate the AMI for the Boston area.

You might be thinking, the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy area is huge! And not only is it geographically large, it also includes a wide range of communities and incomes. Using such a large area for the calculation makes the AMI for the City of Boston seem higher than it actually is.  The City of Boston Median Income is **$65,238** (Household size of 2.8) while the Boston MSA region median family income is **$97,100** (for a household size of 3). That’s a BIG difference!


#### What are different levels of affordability in Boston?

The chart to the left shows the ranges of incomes as represented by AMI. The affordable rent for a two-bedroom apartment is defined as 30% of the income for that household.





### 2c. Affordable to whom?




### 2d. Profile on Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP)

In 2000, the City implemented an Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP), which applies to all privately developed projects. This policy requires that all new developments contribute to the production of new affordable housing in the City. Developers can meet this requirement in three different ways:

1. Include affordable units within their developments (on-site),
2. Create affordable housing in an off-site location, or
3. Make a cash contribution towards the creation or preservation of affordable housing.


IDP units generally target moderate-income families and some middle income families. Ownership units are targeted to slightly higher income limits. IDP funds are used to support publicly-funded projects targeting low and very low-income families.


**Huge Impact:** Under IDP, developers directly created over **2,000 affordable units** and **over $100 million** in the IDP fund helped to support the creation of $1,200 additional affordable units. One thing to keep in mind however, the use of city funds to produce affordable housing is not infinite.
