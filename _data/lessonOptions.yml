        - "1/3 1/3 1/3" is a mix recommended by the City of Boston to achieve affordability and feasibility. This mix calls for one-third of apartments being affordable at 50% AMI, another third being affordable at 80% AMI, and the last third having market rate rents.

        - Finally, "Deep Affordability" is a mix to achieve a very high amount of affordable apartments, with 10% of the apartments being affordable at 30% AMI, another 20% of apartments at 50% AMI, and the remaining 70% of apartments affordable at 60% AMI.
