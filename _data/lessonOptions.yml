# This is a YAML that specifies options and related information that configure
# the scenarios displayed in interactive modules in lessons 01-04.
# Each set of options has:
#   1. A title (usually the same as the lesson's title). This is displayed in H1
#   2. Description text that follows the title, giving more detail on what the interactive module explores.
#   3. A default scenario to display on loading the lesson
#   4. A set of options the user may choose from that control which scenario to load in response that choice.
#       Note: these controls only modify the default scenario by the chosen field.
#       (i.e. choosing 'rentScenario: idpAmiMix on default '16|3|0.5|thirdThirdThird|Standard' will load scenario '16|3|0.5|idpAmiMix|Standard')

        - The "Market Rate" mix is set according to the City of Boston's Inclusionary Development Policy, where 13% of apartments must be affordabel at 70% AMI. The rest of the apartments may have rents set at the prevailing market rates.
        - "1/3 1/3 1/3" is a mix recommended by the City of Boston to achieve affordability and feasibility. This mix calls for one-third of apartments being affordable at 50% AMI, another third being affordable at 80% AMI, and the last third having market rate rents.
        - Finally, "Deep Affordability" is a mix to achieve a very high amount of affordable apartments, with 10% of the apartments being affordable at 30% AMI, another 20% of apartments at 50% AMI, and the remaining 70% of apartments affordable at 60% AMI.
